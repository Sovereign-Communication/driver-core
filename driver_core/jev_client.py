"""The decision tier: Jev, through one client, fail-closed.

This is the module that answers "what should happen next", and it is
deliberately the *weakest* component in the pipeline. It gets a verified
state and a closed vocabulary, and it returns the name of one action plus a
calibrated confidence. That is the whole contract. It does not write
anything, execute anything, or widen its own options.

Three properties carry most of the weight here.

**All-or-nothing signals.** Every declared question either has a validated
answer or has ``None``. There is no partial promotion, because a driver that
acted on two good signals and ignored a third bad one is how a confident wrong
answer gets executed. A malformed, partial, unkeyed or failed call yields an
envelope with every signal ``None`` and ``native=False``.

**The model recommends, the code decides.** ``recommended_action`` is only
ever a name that already exists in the vocabulary. A response naming
something undeclared is not "close enough" -- it is discarded, because an
action the code did not declare is one it cannot bound, consent to, or log.

**One reservation, one dispatch, one settlement, one audit record.** Every
path through this module, including the failure paths, costs exactly one
pre-flight reservation and writes exactly one metadata-only decision record.
The record carries *metadata* -- the chosen action, the distribution, the
confidence -- and never the state that produced it, so the audit log stays
small enough to read and cannot become a second copy of sensitive screen
content.
